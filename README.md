# Lysine_Project
Study of Lysine biosynthesis pathway under saline stress

# Process
1. Establish the Biosynthesis pathway of Lysine in Rice. (Status= Completed)
2. Construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the Pathway. (Status=Completed)
3. Get data for rice seedling under saline stress. (Status=Completed).
4. Data Extraction. (Status=Completed, thanks to Prof. Zhang for providing the annotation file)
5. Data Normalization. (Status=Completed)
6. Data Discretization. (Status=Ongion, Exploring methods for 3 level discretization)
7. Learn Network Parameter. (Status=Pending,Dirichlet- Multinomial Model)
8. Inference simulations. (Status=Pending, to determine regulators of Lysine)
9. Validation if any (Status=Pending, By Khushboo and Dr. Septi)
10. Soft Validation (Status=Pending, Differential Expression Analysis, by Rajan)
